# Recent Notable Updates  
  
- **AI-Assisted Google Search** - Use GPT3 to browse the internet, you can search the internet for a query and GPT3 will look at the top websites for you automatically and formulate an answer to your query! You can also ask follow-up questions, this is kinda like BingGPT, but much better lol!  
<p align="center"/>

</p>  
  
- **CUSTOM INDEXES** - You can now upload files to your discord server and use them as a source of knowledge when asking GPT3 questions. You can also use webpage links as context, images, full documents, csvs, powerpoints, audio files, and even **youtube videos**! Read more in the 'Custom Indexes' section below. Here's an example below with a youtube video:

# Features

- **AI-Assisted Google Search** - Speaks for itself!

- **DALL-E Image Prompt Optimization** - Given some text that you're trying to generate an image for, the bot will automatically optimize the text to be more DALL-E friendly! `/dalle optimize <prompt>`  
  
- **Edit Requests** - Ask GPT to edit a piece of text or code with a given instruction. `/gpt edit <instruction> <text>`  
  
- **DeepL Translations** - Translate text with DeepL. `/translate <text>`  
  
- **Redo Requests** - A simple button after the GPT3 response or DALL-E generation allows you to redo the initial prompt you asked. You can also redo conversation messages by just editing your message!  
  
- **Automatic AI-Based Server Moderation** - Moderate your server automatically with AI!  
  
- **Auto-retry on API errors** - Automatically resend failed requests to OpenAI's APIs!  
  
- Automatically re-send your prompt and update the response in place if you edit your original prompt!  
 
- ShareGPT integration to share your conversations
- Tag your bot in chat and it'll respond!  
- Async and fault tolerant, **can handle hundreds of users at once**, if the upstream API permits!  
- Change and view model parameters such as temp, top_p, and etc directly within discord.   
- Tracks token usage automatically  
- Automatic pagination and discord support, the bot will automatically send very long message as multiple messages, and is able to send discord code blocks and emoji, gifs, etc.  
- A low usage mode, use a command to automatically switch to a cheaper and faster model to conserve your tokens during times of peak usage.   
- Prints debug to a channel of your choice, so you can view the raw response JSON  
- Ability to specify a limit to how long a conversation can be with the bot, to conserve your tokens.  
  
# Commands  
  
These commands are grouped, so each group has a prefix but you can easily tab complete the command without the prefix. For example, for `/gpt ask`, if you type `/ask` and press tab, it'll show up too.  
  
`/help` - Display help text for the bot  
  
### (Chat)GPT3 Commands  
  
`/gpt ask <prompt> <temp> <top_p> <frequency penalty> <presence penalty>` Ask the GPT3 Davinci 003 model a question. Optional overrides available  
  
`/gpt edit <instruction> <input> <temp> <top_p> <codex>` Use the bot to edit text using the given instructions for how to do it, currently an alpha openai feature so results might vary. Codex uses a model trained on code. Editing is currently free  
  
`/gpt converse <opener> <opener_file> <private> <minimal>` - Start a conversation with the bot, like ChatGPT  
  
- `opener:<opener text>` - Start a conversation with the bot, with a custom opener text (this is useful if you want it to take on a custom personality from the start).  
  
- `opener_file:<opener file name>.txt|.json` - Starts a conversation with the bot, using a custom file.   
  
  - Loads files from the `/openers` folder, has autocomplete support so files in the folder will show up. Added before the `opener` as both can be used at the same time  
  
  - Custom openers need to be placed as a .txt file in the `openers` directory, in the same directory as `gpt3discord.py`  
  
 - Enables minimal  
  
  - Can use .json files in the `{"text": "your prompt", "temp":0, "top_p":0,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0}` format to include permanent overrides  
  
- `private` - Start a private conversation with the bot, like ChatGPT  
  
- `minimal` - Start a conversation with the bot, like ChatGPT, with minimal context (saves tokens)  
  
`/gpt end` - End a conversation with the bot.  
  
### DALL-E2 Commands  
  
`/dalle draw <prompt>` - Have DALL-E generate images based on a prompt  
  
`/dalle optimize <image prompt text>` Optimize a given prompt text for DALL-E image generation.  

### Search Commands

`/search query:<prompt> scope:<number of sites to visit> nodes:<how deep gpt3 should think>` - Search the internet with AI assistance!

- The `scope` defines how many top level websites to visit during the search, capped at 6
- `nodes` defines how many nodes inside the built index after webpage retrieval to use. 
- Increasing the scope or the nodes will make the requests take longer and will be more expensive, but will usually be more accurate.
  
### Custom Indexes Commands  
  
This bot supports per-user custom indexes. This means that users can upload files of their choosing, such as PDFs and ask GPT to answer questions based on those files.  
  
`/index add file:<file> or link:<link>` - Use a document or use a link to create/add to your indexes. If you provide a youtube link, the transcript of the video will be used. If you provide a web url, the contents of the webpage will be used, if you provide an image, the image text will be extracted and used!  
  
`/index query query:<prompt> nodes:<number> response_mode:<mode>` - Query your current index for a given prompt. GPT will answer based on your current document/index. You can also set it to query over more nodes, further refining the output over each one. A description of the modes can be found <a href="https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/usage_pattern.html#setting-response-mode">here</a>. They do not work for deep composed indexes  
  
`/index load user_index:<index> or server_index:<index>` - Load a previously created index you own yourself, or an index for the whole server.  
  
`/index compose` - Combine multiple saved indexes into one, or upgrade existing indexes into Deep Compositions.  
  
`/index reset` - Reset and delete all of your saved indexes  
  
`/index add_discord channel:<discord channel>` - Create an add an index based on a discord channel  
  
`/index discord_backup` - Use the last 3000 messages of every channel on your discord server as an index. Needs both an admin and a index role  
  
### System and Settings  
  
`/system settings` - Display settings for the model (temperature, top_p, etc)  
  
`/system settings <setting> <value>` - Change a model setting to a new value. Has autocomplete support, certain settings will have autocompleted values too.  

- For example, if I wanted to change the number of images generated by DALL-E by default to 4, I can type the following command in discord: `/system settings num_images 4`  
  
`/system usage` Estimate current usage details (based on davinci)  
  
`/system settings low_usage_mode True/False` Turn low usage mode on and off. If on, it will use the curie-001 model, and if off, it will use the davinci-003 model.  
  
`/system delete-conversation-threads` - Delete all threads related to this bot across all servers.  
  
`/system local-size` - Get the size of the local dalleimages folder  
  
`/system clear-local` - Clear all the local dalleimages.
